    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> <strong>Muffin</strong> a small, cup-shaped bread, often sweetened and usually served hot. The derivation of the word muffin comes from the French word moufflet which is often times applied to bread and means soft.</p>
<p> British-style muffins were discovered by the Welsh in the 10th century. In the Middle Ages, muffin dough was cooked in a special ring-shaped mold placed directly on the stove or pan. English muffin recipes began to appear in the early 19th century.</p>
